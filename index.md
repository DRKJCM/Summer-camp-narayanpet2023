Further reading

Beyond the quickstart and the manual, Org has a guide and a wealth of community-written documentation on Worg .

Nearly every Org user has a story to tell about how Org enables and empowers them — some have found it so useful that they have written (scientific) papers about the value of Org for conducting reproducible research. Some have produced third party tools to enjoy Org outside of Emacs, such as mobile applications.
More Org

The de facto mimetype for Org files is text/org. Org files use the .org extension. Most operating systems don't know to open .org files in Emacs, but they can be configured to do so without much effort.

While the reference implementation of Org in Emacs lisp is by far the most featureful, there are many additional tools that work with Org.

Tools that work with Org
Worg, a World of Org

Org and Org-mode have so many use cases that it is simply not possible to easily document them, let alone show them all off on a single page. As a result, Worg serves as a community wiki and provides a place to document and share information about all aspects of using and working with Org.

For example, Worg contains:

    The FAQ
    Org hacks
    A list of tutorials
    Documentation on all hooks, commands and options
    Org in the wild
    …and much more

Worg is maintained as a Git repository of Org files that are published as an HTML website. New contributors are welcome.

Doom, Spacemacs, Scimax and popular configs

The Emacs starter kits Doom, Spacemacs and Scimax come with a curated set of packages and configurations that aim to enhance Org mode (and Emacs more generally) for particular use cases. They include Org along with integrations between org-mode and other modes (such as evil-mode). Here are links to the current packages included with Doom, and Spacemacs. Scimax is deeply integrated with Org so a good place to start is the manual. Doom installs a version of Org that is close to the development HEAD, while Spacemacs and Scimax track org elpa.

Starter kits often make significant changes to the default user experience for Emacs. If you are looking for something closer to vanilla Emacs there are popular configs such as Purcell's emacs.d that include org-mode customization and Org-related packages.
